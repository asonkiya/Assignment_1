positive It was delicious!!!
positive Never had anything to complain about here.

positive We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.
negative No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
positive They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.
